                                        Some of them may be to understand counterspeech to posts that might be considered hostile, vulgar, or inflammatory.
                                        Each discussion will have an assigned moderator to ensure that the posted content in a discourse thread is within the bounds of the research objective.
                                        If a post is considered outside of those bounds, it may be flagged or removed at the discretion of the Principal Investigator for that research experiment.
